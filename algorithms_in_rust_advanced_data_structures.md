### 9. Advanced Data Structures

#### Tries and Suffix Trees
1. **Tries**:
   - A trie (pronounced "try") is a tree-like data structure that stores a dynamic set of strings, where the keys are usually strings. Each node represents a character of a string, allowing for efficient retrieval of words and prefix searches.

   - **Insertion and Search**:
   ```rust
   struct TrieNode {
       children: HashMap<char, TrieNode>,
       is_end_of_word: bool,
   }

   struct Trie {
       root: TrieNode,
   }

   impl Trie {
       fn new() -> Self {
           Trie {
               root: TrieNode {
                   children: HashMap::new(),
                   is_end_of_word: false,
               },
           }
       }

       fn insert(&mut self, word: &str) {
           let mut current = &mut self.root;
           for ch in word.chars() {
               current = current.children.entry(ch).or_insert(TrieNode {
                   children: HashMap::new(),
                   is_end_of_word: false,
               });
           }
           current.is_end_of_word = true;
       }

       fn search(&self, word: &str) -> bool {
           let mut current = &self.root;
           for ch in word.chars() {
               if let Some(next) = current.children.get(&ch) {
                   current = next;
               } else {
                   return false;
               }
           }
           current.is_end_of_word
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Suffix Trees**:
   - A suffix tree is a compressed trie containing all the suffixes of a given string. It allows for fast substring searches and can be particularly useful in applications such as DNA sequencing and pattern matching.

   - **Construction**: Building a suffix tree is more complex and typically requires a more advanced algorithm like Ukkonenâ€™s algorithm.

#### Disjoint Set (Union-Find)
1. **Definition**:
   - A disjoint set is a data structure that keeps track of a partition of a set into disjoint (non-overlapping) subsets. It supports two primary operations: `find` (determining which subset a particular element is in) and `union` (joining two subsets into a single subset).

2. **Path Compression and Union by Rank**:
   - To optimize operations, path compression is used during `find`, and union by rank is used during `union`.

   ```rust
   struct DisjointSet {
       parent: Vec<usize>,
       rank: Vec<usize>,
   }

   impl DisjointSet {
       fn new(size: usize) -> Self {
           let parent = (0..size).collect();
           let rank = vec![0; size];
           DisjointSet { parent, rank }
       }

       fn find(&mut self, mut x: usize) -> usize {
           if self.parent[x] != x {
               self.parent[x] = self.find(self.parent[x]); // Path compression
           }
           self.parent[x]
       }

       fn union(&mut self, x: usize, y: usize) {
           let root_x = self.find(x);
           let root_y = self.find(y);
           if root_x != root_y {
               if self.rank[root_x] > self.rank[root_y] {
                   self.parent[root_y] = root_x;
               } else if self.rank[root_x] < self.rank[root_y] {
                   self.parent[root_x] = root_y;
               } else {
                   self.parent[root_y] = root_x;
                   self.rank[root_x] += 1;
               }
           }
       }
   }
   ```

#### Graph Representations
1. **Comparing Adjacency Lists and Matrices**:
   - **Adjacency List**:
     - Space-efficient for sparse graphs.
     - Provides faster traversal of neighbors.
     - Complexity for adding edges: \(O(1)\), for checking existence: \(O(V)\) (where \(V\) is the number of vertices).

   - **Adjacency Matrix**:
     - Space-efficient for dense graphs.
     - Provides \(O(1)\) access time to check if an edge exists between any two nodes.
     - Complexity for adding edges: \(O(1)\), but requires \(O(V^2)\) space.

2. **Choosing the Right Representation**:
   - The choice of representation depends on the application, graph density, and specific operations required.
