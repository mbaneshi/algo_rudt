### 10. Algorithm Analysis

#### Time and Space Complexity
1. **Understanding Complexity**:
   - Time complexity refers to the computational complexity that describes the amount of time it takes to run an algorithm as a function of the length of the input.
   - Space complexity measures the amount of memory space required by an algorithm as a function of the input size.

2. **Big O Notation**:
   - Big O notation provides an upper bound on the time complexity of an algorithm, helping to describe its worst-case scenario.
   - Common complexities include:
     - **O(1)**: Constant time (e.g., accessing an element in an array).
     - **O(log n)**: Logarithmic time (e.g., binary search).
     - **O(n)**: Linear time (e.g., iterating through a list).
     - **O(n log n)**: Log-linear time (e.g., efficient sorting algorithms like mergesort).
     - **O(n²)**: Quadratic time (e.g., bubble sort, selection sort).

   - **Examples**:
   ```rust
   // Constant time - O(1)
   fn constant_time_example(arr: &[i32]) -> i32 {
       arr[0] // Accessing the first element
   }

   // Linear time - O(n)
   fn linear_time_example(arr: &[i32]) -> i32 {
       let mut sum = 0;
       for &num in arr {
           sum += num; // Summing all elements
       }
       sum
   }

   // Quadratic time - O(n²)
   fn quadratic_time_example(arr: &[i32]) {
       for &i in arr {
           for &j in arr {
               println!("i: {}, j: {}", i, j); // Nested loops
           }
       }
   }
   ```

#### Analyzing Algorithms in Rust
1. **Profiling Techniques**:
   - Profiling helps identify performance bottlenecks in Rust programs.
   - Tools such as `cargo bench`, `perf`, or `valgrind` can be used for profiling.
   - Example: Benchmarking with `criterion` crate.
   ```rust
   use criterion::{black_box, criterion_group, criterion_main, Criterion};

   fn bench_example(c: &mut Criterion) {
       c.bench_function("linear_sum", |b| b.iter(|| {
           let arr = (1..1000).collect::<Vec<i32>>();
           linear_time_example(black_box(&arr));
       }));
   }

   criterion_group!(benches, bench_example);
   criterion_main!(benches);
   ```

2. **Benchmarking**:
   - Benchmarking is the process of measuring the performance of an algorithm or function.
   - It provides insights into execution time, allowing for comparisons between different algorithms or implementations.
   - The `criterion` crate is highly recommended for accurate benchmarking.

3. **Best Practices**:
   - Always analyze both time and space complexity when evaluating algorithms.
   - Use profiling tools to gain insights into actual performance during runtime.
   - Write benchmarks for critical components of the code to ensure performance is maintained over changes.
