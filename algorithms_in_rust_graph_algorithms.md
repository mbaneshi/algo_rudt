### 7. Graph Algorithms

#### Basic Graph Theory Concepts
1. **Graph Representation**:
   - Graphs consist of vertices (nodes) and edges (connections between nodes). They can be represented using:
     - **Adjacency Lists**: A collection of lists where each list corresponds to a vertex and contains the adjacent vertices.
     - **Adjacency Matrices**: A 2D array where the element at row \(i\) and column \(j\) indicates the presence or weight of an edge between vertex \(i\) and vertex \(j\).

   ```rust
   use std::collections::HashMap;

   type Graph = HashMap<i32, Vec<i32>>;

   fn create_graph() -> Graph {
       let mut graph: Graph = HashMap::new();
       graph.insert(1, vec![2, 3]);
       graph.insert(2, vec![1, 4]);
       graph.insert(3, vec![1]);
       graph.insert(4, vec![2]);
       graph
   }
   ```

#### Traversal Algorithms
1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
   - A traversal algorithm that explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
   - BFS is particularly useful for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

   ```rust
   use std::collections::VecDeque;

   fn bfs(graph: &Graph, start: i32) {
       let mut visited = HashMap::new();
       let mut queue = VecDeque::new();
       queue.push_back(start);
       visited.insert(start, true);

       while let Some(node) = queue.pop_front() {
           println!("Visited: {}", node);
           if let Some(neighbors) = graph.get(&node) {
               for &neighbor in neighbors {
                   if !visited.contains_key(&neighbor) {
                       visited.insert(neighbor, true);
                       queue.push_back(neighbor);
                   }
               }
           }
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - A traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It can be implemented using recursion or an explicit stack.

   ```rust
   fn dfs(graph: &Graph, start: i32, visited: &mut HashMap<i32, bool>) {
       visited.insert(start, true);
       println!("Visited: {}", start);
       
       if let Some(neighbors) = graph.get(&start) {
           for &neighbor in neighbors {
               if !visited.contains_key(&neighbor) {
                   dfs(graph, neighbor, visited);
               }
           }
       }
   }
   ```

   - **Using Iteration**:
   ```rust
   fn dfs_iterative(graph: &Graph, start: i32) {
       let mut stack = vec![start];
       let mut visited = HashMap::new();

       while let Some(node) = stack.pop() {
           if !visited.contains_key(&node) {
               visited.insert(node, true);
               println!("Visited: {}", node);
               if let Some(neighbors) = graph.get(&node) {
                   for &neighbor in neighbors {
                       stack.push(neighbor);
                   }
               }
           }
       }
   }
   ```

#### Shortest Path Algorithms
1. **Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm**:
   - An algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph with non-negative edge weights.

   ```rust
   use std::collections::{BinaryHeap, HashMap};
   use std::cmp::Ordering;

   #[derive(Debug)]
   struct State {
       node: i32,
       cost: u32,
   }

   impl Ord for State {
       fn cmp(&self, other: &Self) -> Ordering {
           other.cost.cmp(&self.cost) // Reverse order for min-heap
       }
   }

   impl PartialOrd for State {
       fn partial_cmp(&self, other: &Self) -> Option<Ordering> {
           Some(self.cmp(other))
       }
   }

   impl Eq for State {}

   impl PartialEq for State {
       fn eq(&self, other: &Self) -> bool {
           self.cost == other.cost
       }
   }

   fn dijkstra(graph: &Graph, start: i32) -> HashMap<i32, u32> {
       let mut distances = HashMap::new();
       let mut heap = BinaryHeap::new();

       distances.insert(start, 0);
       heap.push(State { node: start, cost: 0 });

       while let Some(State { node, cost }) = heap.pop() {
           if cost > *distances.get(&node).unwrap_or(&u32::MAX) {
               continue;
           }

           if let Some(neighbors) = graph.get(&node) {
               for &neighbor in neighbors {
                   let next_cost = cost + 1; // Assume weight of 1 for simplicity
                   if next_cost < *distances.get(&neighbor).unwrap_or(&u32::MAX) {
                       distances.insert(neighbor, next_cost);
                       heap.push(State { node: neighbor, cost: next_cost });
                   }
               }
           }
       }
       distances
   }
   ```

2. **A* Algorithm**:
   - A heuristic-based algorithm for finding the shortest path in graphs. It combines the benefits of Dijkstra's algorithm with heuristics to improve efficiency.

   ```rust
   // A* implementation would involve a priority queue and a heuristic function,
   // which is specific to the problem context and not included here for brevity.
   ```
