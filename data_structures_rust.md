### 13. Data Structures

Data structures are essential for organizing and managing data efficiently in algorithms. Here’s an overview of common data structures used in Rust and their applications:

#### 13.1 Arrays

- **Definition**: A collection of elements identified by index or key. In Rust, arrays are fixed in size and contain elements of the same type.
- **Use Cases**: Ideal for situations where the size of the dataset is known in advance, such as storing a list of scores or fixed configuration settings.

#### 13.2 Vectors

- **Definition**: A dynamic array provided by Rust’s standard library, allowing for resizing and more flexible management of elements.
- **Use Cases**: Useful for cases where the number of elements may vary, such as collecting user inputs or dynamically managing collections of data.

#### 13.3 Linked Lists

- **Definition**: A collection of nodes where each node contains data and a reference to the next node. Rust does not have built-in linked lists but provides libraries like `linklist` for implementation.
- **Use Cases**: Suitable for situations requiring frequent insertion and deletion of elements, such as implementing queues or stacks.

#### 13.4 Hash Maps

- **Definition**: A collection of key-value pairs that allows for fast retrieval of values based on keys. Rust provides a `HashMap` type in its standard library.
- **Use Cases**: Ideal for associative arrays where quick lookups are needed, such as counting occurrences of elements or storing configuration options.

#### 13.5 Trees

- **Binary Trees**: Each node has at most two children, useful for hierarchical data representation.
- **Binary Search Trees (BST)**: A binary tree where each node follows a specific ordering property, facilitating efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.
- **Use Cases**: Implementing databases, file systems, and any application requiring hierarchical data representation.

#### 13.6 Graphs

- **Definition**: A collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges. Graphs can be directed or undirected, weighted or unweighted.
- **Use Cases**: Modeling networks, social connections, and relationships in data, suitable for pathfinding algorithms like Dijkstra’s and A*.

#### 13.7 Stacks and Queues

1. **Stacks**: A Last In, First Out (LIFO) data structure that allows for push and pop operations.
   - **Use Cases**: Function call management, undo mechanisms in applications.

2. **Queues**: A First In, First Out (FIFO) data structure that allows for enqueue and dequeue operations.
   - **Use Cases**: Task scheduling, print queue management.

### 14. Advanced Data Structures

#### 14.1 Heaps

- **Definition**: A specialized tree-based structure that satisfies the heap property, where the parent node is either greater than or equal to (max heap) or less than or equal to (min heap) its children.
- **Use Cases**: Implementing priority queues and efficient sorting algorithms (e.g., heapsort).

#### 14.2 Tries

- **Definition**: A tree-like data structure that stores a dynamic set of strings, where nodes represent common prefixes.
- **Use Cases**: Autocomplete features in search engines, spell checkers, and IP routing.

#### 14.3 Bloom Filters

- **Definition**: A probabilistic data structure used to test whether an element is a member of a set, with a possibility of false positives but no false negatives.
- **Use Cases**: Caching, network routing, and large-scale database querying.

#### 14.4 Disjoint Set Union (Union-Find)

- **Definition**: A data structure that keeps track of a partition of a set into disjoint subsets. Supports union and find operations efficiently.
- **Use Cases**: Used in network connectivity problems, Kruskal’s algorithm for finding minimum spanning trees.
