### 6. Recursion and Dynamic Programming

#### Understanding Recursion
1. **Base Cases and Recursive Cases**:
   - Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem. Every recursive function must have:
     - A **base case**: the condition under which the recursion stops.
     - A **recursive case**: the condition under which the function calls itself.
   ```rust
   fn factorial(n: u32) -> u32 {
       if n == 0 {
           1 // Base case
       } else {
           n * factorial(n - 1) // Recursive case
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Common Recursive Algorithms**:
   - **Factorial**: The factorial function, as shown above, calculates the product of all positive integers up to \(n\).
   - **Fibonacci Sequence**: A classic example of recursion that calculates the \(n\)th Fibonacci number:
   ```rust
   fn fibonacci(n: u32) -> u32 {
       if n == 0 {
           0 // Base case
       } else if n == 1 {
           1 // Base case
       } else {
           fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2) // Recursive case
       }
   }
   ```
   - **Tower of Hanoi**: A classic problem that involves moving disks between pegs, following specific rules.

#### Introduction to Dynamic Programming
1. **Principles of Dynamic Programming**:
   - Dynamic programming (DP) is a technique used to solve problems by breaking them down into overlapping subproblems and storing the results to avoid redundant calculations.

2. **Memoization vs. Tabulation**:
   - **Memoization**: A top-down approach that caches results of expensive function calls.
   - **Tabulation**: A bottom-up approach that builds a table to store solutions to subproblems iteratively.

3. **Real-World Examples**:
   - **Knapsack Problem**: A problem that involves maximizing value while staying within a weight limit. Using DP, we can solve it efficiently:
   ```rust
   fn knapsack(weights: &[u32], values: &[u32], capacity: u32) -> u32 {
       let n = weights.len();
       let mut dp = vec![vec![0; (capacity + 1) as usize]; (n + 1) as usize];

       for i in 1..=n {
           for w in 0..=capacity {
               if weights[i - 1] <= w {
                   dp[i][w as usize] = dp[i - 1][w as usize].max(dp[i - 1][(w - weights[i - 1]) as usize] + values[i - 1]);
               } else {
                   dp[i][w as usize] = dp[i - 1][w as usize];
               }
           }
       }
       dp[n][capacity as usize]
   }
   ```

4. **Longest Common Subsequence**:
   - Another classic DP problem that finds the longest subsequence common to two sequences:
   ```rust
   fn longest_common_subsequence(s1: &str, s2: &str) -> usize {
       let m = s1.len();
       let n = s2.len();
       let mut dp = vec![vec![0; n + 1]; m + 1];

       for i in 1..=m {
           for j in 1..=n {
               if s1.as_bytes()[i - 1] == s2.as_bytes()[j - 1] {
                   dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
               } else {
                   dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j].max(dp[i][j - 1]);
               }
           }
       }
       dp[m][n]
   }
   ```
