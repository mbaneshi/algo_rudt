   - Big O notation.
   - Analyzing algorithms implemented in Rust.

### 11. Practical Applications of Algorithms
   - Real-world problems and how algorithms solve them.
   - Case studies of algorithms in action (e.g., web scraping, data analysis).

### 12. Conclusion and Further Resources
   - Recap of key concepts.
   - Recommended readings and resources for further study.

### Appendices
