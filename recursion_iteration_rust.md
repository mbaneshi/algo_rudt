### 15. Recursion and Iteration

#### 15.1 Recursion

Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem. It is often used in algorithms that can be defined in terms of smaller subproblems.

- **Base Case**: Every recursive function must have a base case to terminate the recursion. Without it, the function would call itself indefinitely, leading to a stack overflow.
- **Recursive Case**: This part of the function contains the logic that calls the function itself with modified arguments.

**Example**: Calculating factorial using recursion:

```rust
fn factorial(n: u32) -> u32 {
    if n == 0 {
        1
    } else {
        n * factorial(n - 1)
    }
}
```

- **Use Cases**: Recursive algorithms are widely used in problems involving tree traversals, combinatorial problems, and divide-and-conquer algorithms.

#### 15.2 Iteration

Iteration involves using loops to repeat a set of instructions until a condition is met. It’s often more efficient than recursion in terms of memory usage, as it doesn’t require maintaining multiple function calls on the call stack.

**Example**: Calculating factorial using iteration:

```rust
fn factorial(n: u32) -> u32 {
    let mut result = 1;
    for i in 1..=n {
        result *= i;
    }
    result
}
```

- **Use Cases**: Iterative algorithms are commonly used in scenarios where performance and resource constraints are critical, such as processing large datasets or performing repetitive tasks.

#### 15.3 Comparing Recursion and Iteration

- **Memory Usage**: Recursion can lead to high memory usage due to the call stack, while iteration generally uses a fixed amount of memory.
- **Readability**: Recursive solutions can often be more elegant and easier to understand for problems that have a natural recursive structure, like tree traversals.
- **Performance**: Iteration is usually faster than recursion due to the overhead of function calls in recursive implementations. However, tail recursion optimization can mitigate this in some languages.

### 16. Algorithm Design Techniques

#### 16.1 Divide and Conquer

This technique involves breaking a problem down into smaller subproblems, solving each subproblem independently, and combining their solutions to solve the original problem.

- **Examples**: Merge sort, quicksort, and binary search.

#### 16.2 Greedy Algorithms

Greedy algorithms build up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most immediate benefit.

- **Examples**: Dijkstra's algorithm, Prim's algorithm for minimum spanning trees, and Huffman coding.

#### 16.3 Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming is an optimization technique used to solve problems by storing solutions to overlapping subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.

- **Examples**: Fibonacci sequence, knapsack problem, and longest common subsequence.

#### 16.4 Backtracking

Backtracking is a refinement of the brute-force approach that incrementally builds candidates for solutions and abandons them as soon as it determines that they cannot be extended to a valid solution.

- **Examples**: Solving puzzles like Sudoku, generating permutations, and solving the N-Queens problem.
