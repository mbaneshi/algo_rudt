### 3. Basic Data Structures

#### Arrays and Slices
1. **Definition and Use Cases**:
   - An array is a fixed-size collection of elements of the same type. The size must be known at compile time.
   - Slices are dynamically-sized views into arrays, allowing flexible handling of data.
     ```rust
     let arr: [i32; 4] = [1, 2, 3, 4];
     let slice: &[i32] = &arr[1..3]; // slice contains [2, 3]
     ```

2. **Common Operations**:
   - Accessing elements, iterating, and modifying values are standard operations.
   - Example of iterating through an array:
     ```rust
     for &num in &arr {
         println!("{}", num);
     }
     ```

3. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Arrays have a constant time complexity \(O(1)\) for indexing.
   - Slices do not own the data; they merely provide a view, which can be advantageous for performance when dealing with large datasets.

#### Vectors
1. **Dynamic Arrays and Resizing**:
   - Vectors (`Vec<T>`) are growable arrays that can resize as elements are added or removed.
     ```rust
     let mut vec = Vec::new();
     vec.push(1);
     vec.push(2);
     ```

2. **Implementation Details**:
   - Vectors manage memory efficiently, reallocating space as needed. They start with a capacity that grows as elements are added.

3. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Vectors provide amortized \(O(1)\) complexity for appending elements, but resizing incurs a \(O(n)\) cost when it occurs.

#### Strings and String Slices
1. **Managing Text Data**:
   - Rust offers two primary string types: `String`, a mutable owned string, and `&str`, an immutable string slice.
     ```rust
     let mut s = String::from("Hello");
     s.push_str(", world!"); // s is now "Hello, world!"
     ```

2. **Performance Differences**:
   - `String` manages its own memory and can grow, while `&str` is more lightweight, serving as a view into a string without ownership.
   - Operations on `&str` are often faster due to their immutability.

#### Hash Maps and Sets
1. **Key-Value Storage and Uniqueness Guarantees**:
   - Hash maps (`HashMap<K, V>`) store pairs of keys and values, allowing efficient retrieval based on keys.
     ```rust
     use std::collections::HashMap;

     let mut scores = HashMap::new();
     scores.insert(String::from("Alice"), 50);
     scores.insert(String::from("Bob"), 70);
     ```

2. **Performance Analysis**:
   - Average-case time complexity for insertions, deletions, and lookups is \(O(1)\).
   - The actual performance can depend on factors such as the hash function and the load factor.

3. **Practical Applications**:
   - Hash maps are widely used for counting occurrences, caching results, and implementing associative arrays.
